						<p class="card-text">Your page should have the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The name of your chosen one</li>
							<li>A picture of them</li>
							<li>Say something nice! Maybe what they're like, give some praise, share a cute memory of them</li>
							<li>A link to their Facebook</li>

						<h5 class="card-title">How do I do the do</h5>
						<p class="card-text">All you really need is a text-editor, Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac. From here, you'll type up the HTML and design the page from there. At the very end, I'll host all the pages (or I'll try to) for y'all to see.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Why am I doing this?</h5>
						<p class"card-text">Hopefully for y'all, this will be an easy task, even if it takes like fifteen minutes to do. This is geared more towards people without experience coding (if you already know how to, I am sorry, I have failed you :( ). Coding in general is a pretty valuable skill, and hopefully, especially for those interested in Admin VP, this will be a small taste of basic web design. Bonus points if you find a cringey picture for this.</p>

			<h3>So what do I do?</h3>
			<p>Alright, so if you have no idea with what to do, here's how you start. First thing you have to do is pull up your text editor; I'm using Notepad here. Start your document with <span>&lt!DOCTYPE&#160;html&gt</span>, which will tell the browser what version of HTML you are writing in. After that follow it with &lthtml&gt and &lt/html&gt</p>
			<img src="jordan1.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>In html, these short combinations letters within the arrows are called tags. They generally come in pairs, defining a certain body of code within it. The first tag opens the container for the code, and the second one closes it. The second tag will have a backslash (/) in front of the letters to indicate it is closing. In this case, the tags &lthtml&gt and &lt/html&gt will contain code that will be interpreted as html (surprise). To start making the body of the page, add the tags &ltbody&gt and &lt/body&gt within the body of the html tags.</p>
			<img src="jordan2.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>So far, we haven't actually made anything show up on the page. Let's start with the title of the page. The tag for headings in html are &lth1&gt (and closed with &lth1&gt), where you can change the number to make the font size smaller. Say you want to write the name of your pbro (say it's Jordan Shen). Simply write his name in between the tags. Put this title within your body tags.</p>
			<img src="jordan3.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Let's write something about our favorite pbro. This time, we'll use the tag &ltp&gt (closed with &lt/p&gt, p stands for paragraph). Write whatever you want in between the lines.</p>
			<img src="jordan4.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Now, let's put in a picture of Jordan. This is a little different, because images don't need a closing tag; the &ltimg&gt tag stands alone. Instead of putting information on the element in between two tags, we're going to put the information inside the brackets. Specifically, we're going to write the source url as an attribute in the angle brackets of the tag. Write src and set it equal to your image's url in quotes. You can find some picture on Facebook or Instagram, right-click it and copy the image URL to here</p>
			<img src="jordan5.png" class="img-fluid">
			<img src="jordan6.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Last step, putting in the link to his facebook. The tag for links are &lta&gt (and closed with &lt/a&gt). We will another attribute (so placing something within the brackets of the first tag) to define where we are linking to. To do that, we set href equal to the link we want to go to (href="facebook.com/url"), all in the &lta&gt tag. But now we need text to click. On the inside of the two tags, we'll write "click me" or something.</p>
			<img src="jordan7.png" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Finally, save the file as PersonsName.html</p>
			<p>Send it to me on Facebook, and I'll sign your signature task sheet~</p>
			<p>Good luck!</p>
